# BankAccountSimulation
Our goal in this project is to create a simple banking system which allows a banker to manage different bank accounts. As a banker, you would create new accounts, deposit to an account, withdraw from an account, transfer money from one account to another, delete account, sort the accounts, or do inspection on one or all bank accounts. Using C++, I designed a banking program that emulates how a bank runs an online system. In this program, the user is presented the following menu in order to do the above tasks.
- Create and delete new bank accounts
- Deposit, withdraw, and transfer money in between accounts
- View specific account details by using an account's number
- View details of all accounts all at once
- Activate/Deactivate individual accounts
